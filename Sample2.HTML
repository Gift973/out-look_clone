            I am a software engineer currently learning at the Power Learn Project February 2025 Cohort. Through this program, I am gaining skills in web development, programming, and problem-solving.

I have experience with Python, JavaScript, and databases, and I enjoy building applications that solve real-world problems. I am also learning about cloud computing and API development to improve my skills.

I love working with others, sharing ideas, and continuously learning. My goal is to use technology to create impactful solutions and grow as a developer
